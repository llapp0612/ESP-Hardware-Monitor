# ESP Hardware Monitor

This project involves building an ESP32 hardware monitor that displays PC hardware data on a 3.5-inch touch LCD screen. The monitor utilizes the following components:

Seengreat 3.5 Inch Touch LCD Screen for Arduino: This TFT resistive touch shield with a resolution of 480×320 provides a clear and engaging display for hardware data.Link to product on Amazon
WINGONEER® Prototype PCB for Arduino UNO R3 Shield Board DIY: This PCB offers a solid platform for assembling the ESP32 and LCD screen.Link to product on Amazon
AZDelivery ESP32 NodeMCU D1 R32 WLAN Development Board: This board provides WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity and is equipped with a CH340G chip. It serves as the central control unit of the monitor, facilitating communication with the Windows Form app via a serial connection.Link to product on Amazon
The data is collected via a Windows Form app in C# and then sent to the ESP32 through the serial connection. The PC app can be accessed via the following GitHub link: GitHub - llapp0612/ESP-Hardware-Monitor-PC-App.

A detailed assembly guide for the ESP32 Hardware Monitor will be available soon. Stay tuned for updates!
